"Database recreation script for Rails projects"
"Chromium/Google Chrome flash saving script"

How to these scripts:
1. Create your bash_aliases file (if your already have one, simply open it up).
2. copy and paste the contents of db_recreate to your bash_aliases file then Save.
3. Reopen your terminal. Existing terminals should be closed for the new code to take effect.

Note: if using oh-my-zsh, copy the scripts in your ~/.zshrc file.
